# Overview and Ionic Currents
- Neuroscience now is about understanding and developing Engineering Level descriptions of Brain Sytems and "Circuits".
- There have been tremendous improvements in the technology to image and track changes in the brain.
- What we're after is how to relate this information to the "Circuit Models" which are being developed.
- Here is an example probe:
![Neuropixels Probes Carandini](images/neuropixel-probe-image.png)
- How do you relate this high dimensional datasets and use them?
- You use Mathematical Techniques to analyze meural data in a way that allows us to relate it to mathematical models.
- Song birds learn by imitating their parents songs.
- The course goals are:
  1. Understand the basic biophysics of neurons and networks and other pricniples underlying brain and cognitive functions.
  2. Use mathematical techniques to:
    * Analyze simple models of neurons and networks.
    * Do data analysis of behavioral and neuronal data.
  3. Become proficient at using numerical methods to implement these techniques.
![Course Topics](images/topics-of-the-course.png)
- We're going to start with a model of Neuron:
![Circuit Model of a Neuron](images/circuit-model-of-a-neuron.png)
- We do this since it's important that the current, voltage, resistance is well defined for the model of the brain.
![Cluster Diagram of Neuron Types](images/cluster-diagram-of-neuron-type.png)
- Neurons also have complex morphologies.
- If combine a capacitor with a resistor then it looks like a filter.
- For a circuit, you need wires and we therefore our *Circuit Model of the Brain* needs them too.
- This is the intra and extra cellular solution which is our wires.
- This area is filled with a salt solution.
- The first thing we need to discuss will be **Thermal Energy**.

![Random Walking Partcle](images/particle-collisions-random-walk.png)
- Counter intuitively, **Diffusion** is fast at short length scales and slow at long length scales.
![Diffucsion Time lapse](images/diffusion-inside-human-body.png)
- It takes a very long time for the distribution of particles to flatten out.
- There are more combinations where a particle can do some lefts, then some rights and end up back where it started.
![One Dimensional Random Walk](images/random-walk-timestep-particle.png)
- What is the average displacement?:
![Average Displacement](images/displacement-calculate-equation.png)
- What this means is that the center of the distribution has not changed.
- Calculating the the average distance is simply the variance in Statistical terms:
![Particle Variance Calculation](images/particle-variance-calculation-equaton.png)
- This just means that the variance grows as a constant rate.
- **Diffusion Coefficient**:
![Diffusion Coefficient](images/derive-diffusion-coefficient.png)
- **The Distance that a particle diffuses - on average, from it's starting point - grows with the square root of time.**
- Now we'll look at **Fisk's First Law**:
  1. Diffusion produces a net flow of particles from regions of high concentration to regions of lower concentration.
  2. The flux of particles is proportional to the concentration gradient.
- If you divide by the distance then it looks like a derivative:
![Fick's First Law Derivation](images/ficks-first-law-derivation.png)
- Current flow in neuron's obeys Ohm's Law.
![Ohm's Law](images/neurons-obey-ohms-lay.png)
![Where Does Ohms Law Come From?](images/where-does-ohms-law-come-from.png)
![Eintstein-Smoluchovski Relation](images/einstein-smoluchovski-relation.png)
- Resistivity in the brain is really lousy.
- Due to this, the brain has to create this gimmick - an **Action Potential** to actually send anything.


# RC Circuit and Nernst Potential
- Today we're going to start working on the **Resistor-Capacitor** model.
- Many, if not most, ion channels are sensitive to voltage.
- Nearly every aspect of computation and signaling in a neuron is controlled by voltage.
- Neurons can do numerical integration over time:
![Neural Integration](images/neurons-analog-integration.png)
- A **Capacitor** is two wires separated by an insulator.
![Capacitor Symbol](images/capacitor-symbol.png)
- As positive charges build on the inside of the membrane, they repel positive charges on the outside of the membrane.
![Ions Being Repelled via Membrane](images/ions-being-repelled-by-membrane.png)
- An electric field over some distance corresponds to a voltage difference.
- The **Capacitance of Current** is just the rate at which charge imbalance is changing.
![Change in Voltage of a Neuron](images/change-in-voltage-equation.png)
- We can integrate to get the the total change in voltage:
![Differential Injected Voltage](images/differential-equation-for-injected-voltage.png)
- Cell membranes allow the current to flow around it.
- What happens when you poke a hole in the cell membrane and it starts to leak?
- The effect can simply be modeled as a resistor.
- The leaked current and the passing current has to be equal to the passing current.
![Simple Leakage Equation](images/our-simple-leakage-model.png)
![Finalized Equation](images/finalized-simple-leak-equation.png)
- After we Steady-State the Differential Equation, we just get Ohm's Law back out with different symbols.
![Finalized Finalized Leakage Equation](images/finalized-finalized-Simple-Leakage-Equation.png)
- The derivative always approaches zero in this case at an exponential rate:
![Derivative of Voltage](images/how-does-change-in-voltage-behave.png)
![Response to Current Injection](images/response-to-current-injection.png)
- It is easier to think about resistance in terms of **Conductance**.
![Definition of Conductance](images/definition-of-conductance.png)
- The total *Capacitance* is just the sum of the *Capacitance*.
- The capacitance of a cell depends linearly on its surface area.
- You can write the membrane time constant as capacitance per unit Area over conductance per unit area:
![Membrane Time Constant](images/membrane-time-constant.png)
- Without a battery, the "circuit" just returns to 0 once we turn the voltage off.
- The cell "connects this battery" at different times to different "wires" for different action potentials.
- Where do the batteries of a neuron come from?:
  1. Ion concentration gradients.
  2. Ion-selective permeability of ion channels.
![ Nernst Potential ](images/nerst-potential-equation.png)
- This is complicated so we're going to use the **Boltzman Equation** instead:
